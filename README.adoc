= Project: Testing Kotlin with Spring

Welcome at my new project.

I want to start learning some Kotlin in combination with Spring.
Within this repository you should find some small projects where I try out some things.

I'm using Maven 3.6.3 as build tool.
Spring Boot in v. 2.5.2 and Kotlin v. 1.5.2.

Hope you find something you could need.

This being said!
Happy coding!

NOTE: I'm not perfect, if you see something which might be outdated or seems a bad practise, please leave a note as issue, best case with a proper suggestion doing better!
Thanks in advance for this!
