= Testing-Kotlin-with-Spring - Simple REST-Server App

I made my own hands-on work with Maven and Kotlin based on https://github.com/antonarhipov[#antonarhipov] and his https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/spring-time-in-kotlin-episode1[hands-on repository].

This is my first work with Kotlin in combination with Maven and Spring seeing how thinks work together.
Maybe I will spend some time extending this in the near future.
Leave a comment if you see something strange or possibilities for doing better.
